# Heading 1
**Graham Gardner**

I decided to take this class because coding has always interested me.  I also hope to one day have a website of my own and I feel like this class will be very helpful in better understanding the upkeep and safety behind keeping a website running safely and efficiently.
  
1. I want to learn how to protect against cyber attacks
2. To be able to better understand how the internet works as a whole
3. To be able to understand simple code and write simple code.
