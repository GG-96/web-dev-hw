there can be one head and one body element in each page. the head element can contain some different distinguishing elements but most of the pages information and content live within the body element of the page.

The difference between structural and semantic markup is structural markup gives information about the structure of a document while semantic markup is used to create meaning to the web page rather than just presentation such as headings and paragraphs.
